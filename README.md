# Hello-World
Hello World

Hello, I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To learn them is my real test
To implement them is my cause

I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Each Code to understand
The power that's inside

Ruby, gotta learn it all
Its you and me
I know it's my destiny
Ruby, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Ruby, gotta implement it all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through

You teach me and I'll teach you
Ruby, gotta learn it all
Gotta learn it all
Yeah

Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place

Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream

Ruby, gotta learn it all
Its you and me
I know it's my destiny
Ruby, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Rub, gotta learn it all
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
